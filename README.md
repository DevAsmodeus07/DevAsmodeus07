# Hi, I'm Kenechukwu

## Blockchain Developer
I’m a **Blockchain Developer** specializing in both **infrastructure development** and **smart contract development.** I work across the blockchain stack; from designing consensus mechanisms and custom protocols to building secure and efficient smart contracts for decentralized solutions.

My core programming languages are *Rust*, *Solidity*, *Vyper*, *JavaScript*, *C++*, *Move* and *Python* which I use to deliver scalable, secure, and innovative blockchain solutions. With strong problem-solving skills and a focus on performance and reliability, I thrive in building technologies that power the next generation of decentralized systems.

I’m passionate about leveraging blockchain technology to deliver real-world impact and open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and global partnerships within the Web3 ecosystem.
